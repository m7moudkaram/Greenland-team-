Crop Monitoring Using Color Analysis

A simple and effective computer vision project that analyzes plant health using color segmentation (green, yellow, and brown regions). The project detects how healthy a plant is based on the color distribution in the leaves.

 Project Overview

This project uses OpenCV and HSV color segmentation to analyze crop health from an image.
It calculates the percentage of:
 Green → Healthy tissue

 Yellow → Early stress or disease

 Brown → Dead or infected areas

 Based on these values, the system classifies the plant as:

Healthy

Early stress or disease

Unhealthy
