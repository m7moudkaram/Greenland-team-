Crop Monitoring Using Color Analysis

A simple and effective computer vision project that analyzes plant health using color segmentation (green, yellow, and brown regions). The project detects how healthy a plant is based on the color distribution in the leaves.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses OpenCV and HSV color segmentation to analyze crop health from an image.
It calculates the percentage of:
 Green → Healthy tissue

 Yellow → Early stress or disease

 Brown → Dead or infected areas

 Based on these values, the system classifies the plant as:

Healthy

Early stress or disease

Unhealthy
